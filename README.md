# WWDC18 Scholarship submission

My WWDC18 Scholarship submission is built around how atomic clocks work. Due to a power outage in Eastern Europe, the AC frequency wasn't at its regular 50 Hz for a few weeks. Because of this, most clocks around the house were off by 5-6 minutes, while my iPhone was not. This got me wondering how atomic clocks help GPS satellites and NTP servers keep time accurately to the nanosecond.

After three weeks of convincing myself I wouldn't win a scholarship by any chance, Apple sent me an email telling me I in fact did win!
