# WWDC18 scholarship submission (won)

Every year, **Apple** selects 350 students worldwide who are given the chance to attend the infamous worldwide developers conference, **WWDC**, in San Jose, fully free of charge. Applicants are judged on a coding submission and written essays.


## My 2018 submission

My submission is built around how atomic clocks work. Due to a power outage in Eastern Europe in early 2018, the AC frequency wasn't at its regular `50 Hz` for a few weeks (more [in this article](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095440/europe-clocks-running-slow-electricity-frequency-kosovo-serbia)). Because of this, most clocks around the house were off by 5-6 minutes, while my iPhone was not. This got me wondering how atomic clocks help `GPS` satellites and `NTP` servers keep time accurately to the *nanosecond*.

### Update: Apple selected my submission!

Apple awarded me a WWDC18 scholarship. In June 2018, I went down to San Jose, California for a week of pure fun.
